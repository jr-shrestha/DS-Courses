### Making run_analysis

## How to make it work.
*run_analysis<- function(directory1, directory2, headerfilename, filename, variant1, variant2)

## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
## the location of the TXT files ex. test or train.
        
## 'filetype' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
## the file type ex: .txt; .csv and etc.
        
## 'headerfilename' is the complete name of the file containing the headers.
## ex: features.txt.
        
## 'filename' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
## name of the file to the data to be exported into a .csv file. 
        
## 'variant1' and 'variant2' are characters vector of length 1 indicating
## which variants to use ex: mean and std.
*The final output will be in a .txt file
