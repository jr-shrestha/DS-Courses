###DS Specialization Courses  
This repository has my codes and answers for the DS specialization.  

### The Capstone project.
In this project, we receive a text data set from English origin and we are supposed to create an APP capable of predicting the next possible word. The functionality of the app should be like the [SwiftKey]( http://swiftkey.com/en/) app. The APP is in R and converted to Shiny.  
This aim of this capstone project is to develop a data scientist mind. Therefore, we are supposed to learn how to acquire, clean, explore, interpret, develop workarounds, create logical reasoning, develop codes, improve predictive accuracy, reduce computational runtime and model complexity, and for last, present your final findings.  
To see my final app please visit the link https://rodrigodealexandre.shinyapps.io/predictive_text_model/
My short version of the milestone report can be download from [here](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/blob/master/Capstone/Milestone/Milestone_short.pdf) and the full version with the codes [here](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/blob/master/Capstone/Milestone/Milestone.pdf).  
My final report can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/blob/master/Capstone/Reproducible-Report-Submission/Reproducible_Report.pdf).

### Practical Machine Learning
For this course we were supposed to work with two sets of data, the training and th test. The final report was called PredictionAssignmentWriteup.

### Developing Data Products

In this course, we had our first interaction with shinyapps. As result from the course, we were supposed to create a simple app with the iris dataset. The final app can be found at this [link](https://rodrigodealexandre.shinyapps.io/DataProducts/).
Furthermore, for this course we also made slides to explain how this app works. These slide can be found in this [link](http://rodrigodealexandre.github.io/DS-Courses/Developing%20Data%20Products/data/petalplant/#1)
