###DS Specialization Courses  
This repository has my codes and answers for the DS specialization.  

### The Capstone project.
In this project, we receive a text data set from English origin and we are supposed to create an APP capable of predicting the next possible word. The functionality of the app should be like the (SwiftKey)[ http://swiftkey.com/en/] app. The APP is in R and converted to Shiny.  
This aim of this capstone project is to develop a data scientist mind. Therefore, we are supposed to learn how to acquire, clean, explore, interpret, develop workarounds, create logical reasoning, develop codes, improve predictive accuracy, reduce computational runtime and model complexity, and for last, present your final findings.  
To see my final app please visit the link https://rodrigodealexandre.shinyapps.io/predictive_text_model/
