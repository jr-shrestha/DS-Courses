The functionality of the app should be like the [SwiftKey]( http://swiftkey.com/en/) app. The APP is in R and converted to Shiny.  \r\nThis aim of this capstone project is to develop a data scientist mind. Therefore, we are supposed to learn how to acquire, clean, explore, interpret, develop workarounds, create logical reasoning, develop codes, improve predictive accuracy, reduce computational runtime and model complexity, and for last, present your final findings.  \r\nTo see my final app please visit the link https://rodrigodealexandre.shinyapps.io/predictive_text_model/\r\nMy short version of the milestone report can be download from [here](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/blob/master/Capstone/Milestone/Milestone_short.pdf) and the full version with the codes [here](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/blob/master/Capstone/Milestone/Milestone.pdf).  \r\nMy final report can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/blob/master/Capstone/Reproducible-Report-Submission/Reproducible_Report.pdf).  \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Practical Machine Learning\r\n\r\nFor this course, we were supposed to work with two sets of data, the training and th test. The final report was called PredictionAssignmentWriteup.\r\nTo see the index.html or report.html for this report please click on this [link](http://rodrigodealexandre.github.io/DS-Courses/Practical%20Machine%20Learning/data/).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Developing Data Products\r\n\r\nIn this course, we had our first interaction with shinyapps. As result from the course, we were supposed to create a simple app with the iris dataset. The final app can be found at this [link](https://rodrigodealexandre.shinyapps.io/DataProducts/).\r\nFurthermore, for this course we also made slides to explain how this app works. These slide can be found at this [link](http://rodrigodealexandre.github.io/DS-Courses/Developing%20Data%20Products/data/petalplant/#1).\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Research \r\n\r\nThe assignment 1 can be seen at this [link](http://rodrigodealexandre.github.io/DS-Courses/Reproducible%20Research/data/PA1/PA1_template.html)\r\nThis course assignment 2 can be seen at this [link](http://rodrigodealexandre.github.io/DS-Courses/Reproducible%20Research/data/PA2/Peer%20Assessment%202.html) or at [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/rodrigodealexandre/17811).\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Regression Models \r\n\r\nWork for the course Regression Models can be found in this [link](http://rodrigodealexandre.github.io/DS-Courses/Regression%20Models/Data/Course%20Project.html).\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### R programing\r\n\r\nThis course was my first contact with R. Here I've learn the basic principles of R programing\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Getting and Cleaning Data\r\n\r\nThis lecture was attend at the same time as R programing. At the same time we learned the basics of programming, we also learned how to obtain and clean data using R.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\r\n\r\nThe aim of this course was to learn how to plot with R with multiple graphical devices.\r\nSee [assignment 1](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/tree/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/Data/Assignment%201) and [assignment 2](https://github.com/rodrigodealexandre/DS-Courses/tree/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/Data/Assignment%202) graphs.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-57257804-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
